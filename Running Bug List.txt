RUNNING LIST OF BUGS:

Note, the output is currently the .data section followed by the IR followed by the actual valid MIPS code.

On moment of truth.s which is compiled from testcases4kc.tiger
lw $f0 -> l.s
sw $f0 -> s.s
sw p -> sw $fp //this could be $sp too
sw int_var -> sw $fp?? //possibly $fp or $sp?
sw int_type_var-> sw $fp ??
sw float_type_var-> sw $fp ?? //these three always seemed to be in a place where storing fp would be appropriate.
sw 5.0 -> sw 5, 0($sp)??

Its recommended that you just recompile and take a look at the MIPS output for yourself...
