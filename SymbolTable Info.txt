Symbols for Table:

Vars, -> initial value. Linked list traversal w/ scope check.
Types, -> Backing Type (Int, Float, etc)
Functions, -> Return type (no need for params, since only one
function of a name can exist)

== All have <Scope> <ID> ==
Do scope declaration in grammar. Each time leaving a block, 
scope becomes parent scope. Assign <Scope> to that scope
declaration when desired. This allows for each var/type/func
to be scoped appropriately.
